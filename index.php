<h3>Joint Access Mesh Networks</h3>

<h2>What is Janmesh? What is a Janmesh box? </h2>
<strong>Janmesh</strong> (SSID http://janmesh.clewn.org) is a citizen-to-citizen networking initiative, running nodes with an active <strong>CoOoOW</strong> stack (<em>cjdns</em> over <em>OLSRD</em> over open WiFi), that provide an alternative communication medium resistant to severely communication network-disruptive situations. <br/>
<strong>A Janmesh box</strong> is a computing device (typically an old laptop or a cheap one SoC/SbC computing device) running as a Janmesh network node, connected to neighbourhood's nodes, and serving mesh connectivity and services toward the home LAN network<br/>
<div style="float;right;">
<h2>How is the Janmesh Project doing?</h2>
A full documentation to get a working CoOoOW stack with basic Ubuntu GNU/Linux computers is available. The network is up and runing at a local scale<br>
<h2>Documentation and tutorials</h2>
<h3>Beginner</h3>
Read how to connect two machines in mesh mode, using their wifi links and a CoOoOw stack, from scratch, using GUI tools ; or, to add a new machine to your existing mesh network using command line. Then, learn more about firefall to secure (network) access to your devices.  <a href="index-main.php">-Read more-</a>.
<br/>
<h3>Intermediate</h3>
Lear how to use one machine that operate Janmesh over Wifi and that is connected to Internet through Ethernet to act as a gateway and NAT box in order to allow other devices with (meshing) wifi only to share its Internet access.  <a href="intermediate.php">-Read more -</a>

<h2 style="clear:both;">And now learn more about citizen-to-citizen networking future...</h2>
<h2>The connectivity to the mesh network can ben tunneled through a long-range directionnal radio link to connect distant communities</h2>
<h3>Or tunneled over Internet -or any other network medium- to rely distant places of the world</h3>

<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<h2>What can I do with a Janmesh in my neighbourhood already? Do I have to wait for further developments to make something useful?</h2>
In short, you don't have to wait. If you have physical or remote access to your Janmesh node station, you can just use out-of-the-box any network services such as SMTP mails, HTTP/FTP file transfer or just any other common protocol, with the requirement that you'll have to know the IPv6 adress of the machine you'll want to talk to. 
<h2>Is Janmesh using only radio link? Can I use some other kind of networking medium? </h2>
You can use any networking medium to setup an operate your CoOoOw stacks. You can use an ethernet cable to connect with a close neighbour, as well as associated BPL interfaces to connect with other homes using the same electrical power transformator than you (typically, your block and nearest ones). 
<h2>Why Janmesh? Why spend your sweat and energy to propel the whole project?</h2>
I'm not sure. I'm having fun with experimenting neigbourhood networking since the early 2000's. I just cannot prevent myself to stop. I was hoping my close neighbours would read all this and mesh with me, to aae share files or text messages or built whatever useful. This hasn't happened. To speak frankly, I think that the bricks layed here can only be useful in case of severely disruptive conditions, like say, useful to <strong>survivalists</strong> to get <strong>post-apocalyptic communication means</strong> to link communities. I don't believe frankly in such a scenario on my own, but if this can be useful, I'm happy to help. (<em>Shangri-l on June '18</em>)
